# Straberry farm crop-season story. 
In the morning the strawberry field row markings will be checked from yesterday if there is time. 
This is done to make sure everything about the situation in the field is clear. The day begins, 

first customer arrives. His reserving is checked and he is "signed in" to farm. He is guided to the reserved row to pick his own berries. 
Also it is made sure he knows how picking is done and how markings will be put to the row when picking is finished. 
Reqular customers do not need any advices. When customer has finished, he will come to checkout point  where picked berries are weighted, 
possibly packed and customer is charged. Customer's actual picked amout is recorded and compared against the order. Customer will be asked 
if the assigned rows were picked clean or where the picking actually ended. 

Reservations are received by phone during the day. Reservation is a negotiation situation: we have understanding how much unreserved strawberries 
there is available and when. We give customer options and he in the end decides if he makes a reservation for a certain date/time. We try to avoid 
overbooking while making sure that all the berries are picked when ready. 

Uncertainty is greater the further from current date the reservation is made. 
Questimate about crops is ofcource more accurate closer we get to the reservation date. 
Weather affects to the Questimate. 

Customers may cancel reservations and we may have to cancel reservations in case of strawberry crops not 
developing as we have estimated. All this affects to estimated free strawberry crops amount.

Every evening estimates on crops amounts in future is updated by the actual strawberry crops picked so far and the current weather prediction.

This will be repeated untill the season is over, 3-5 weeks.
