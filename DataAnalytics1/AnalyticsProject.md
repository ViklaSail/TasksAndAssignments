# General instructions
* Do piece by piece. 
* Descriptive analytics task, 
* Decide on what field, subject, area of interest you would like to do this excercise
* Select data source(s) to be used
* Use Pandas and matplotlb or seaborn.

## evaluation details OF THIS PART to be evalueated. 
* Jupyter document 70 % weight: need to tell story which is readable, clear and well structured. 
* Pipeline software 30 % weight: 
1.  Need to have test part simulating data inflow
2.  need to have code you have tried in Jupyter document
3.  need to have result file having visualization data OR need to use matplot lib to show data 
4.  Need to change every time new "record" of data is received (from step i) 
# structure of work
Requirements: use Pandas and if needed numpy and scipy. Use some visualization library. 
## Data Analytics: Story of data with Jupyter.
Plan your pipeline. Requirements. 
### additional guidelines you may want to think about
Tell what you want to do. Tell how you do it. If possible, tell why you do it, what is the purpose. In between you put pieces of python code, by which you are telling HOW you do it. All kind of interesting python code trials you want to include are fine also. if you try something and then decide not to use it, that can be inlcuded in the end. Just make it so that the Jupyter document is clear. 
## Data Analytics:  software for pipeline in python
1. Make a test code which feeds the data to your analytics code. 
2. make a simple analytics code which just takes in the data and does some simple calculation with it and outputs results of those to text file. 

# Possible data sources/areas of interest
* Covid
* weather
* Superstore Sales from BA1
Lot of open data available: google open data sources.
