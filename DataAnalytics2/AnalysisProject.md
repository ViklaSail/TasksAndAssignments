# Description on evaluated task
This will be developing untill saturday 31.10. after that only clarifications

* Groups assumed to be same as in data analytics 1.
* Adding to project from data analytics 1 OR starting a new one
  * Lets have a discussion and see what is needed. 

* You can participate to a competition
  * received instructions earlier, remind me to give you those

If requirements are not fitting to the topic, then explanation about why is acceptable "result" in documentation


# Requirements.
* All applicable rules and instructions in AnalyticsProject.md are followed.   
* Again: a plan document with the story of the data. 
* In addition:
* (try to do predictive analysis)
* have at least two measurements/variables used.
  * meaning at least two data columns in 
* Combine those two data columns from different data sources
  * so data must have relation to use for combination 

# HEADINGS / CHAPTERS in the Jupyter notebook

2. Story of data
  * describe variables (at least two) used. Describe data sources that are being 
  * Do different kind of trials and use all visualizations we have done
  * describe any shortages/needs/lack you need to address 
  * for the main variable **try** to find variables that correlate. document all trials.
  * UNDER DISCUSSION. if you do not find correlating, fake something that correlates for the purposes of exercise (ofcource cannot use that for the competition in case participating)
     * document any kind of issues related to causality concerns
  
3. Plan document
* consider all things in first lecture. Following headings you must have
  1. Collecting data / selecting data
  2. preprocessing data
